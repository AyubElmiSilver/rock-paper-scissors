# rock-paper-scissors

This project will be a game that will be played against the computer. The project will be broken down into certain components.

The first part will begin with a function that will randomly return 'Rock' or 'Paper' or 'Scissors' from an array list.  This will be considered the computers choice.
The second part will add on from the first part by taking in a user input and creating conditional statements depending on the selected combination by user and computer with a declared winner message. 
The third part will create functions and variable that will be used to keep track of the player and computer points which will be used to declare the winner at the end of the game.
