# rock-paper-scissors

This project will be a game that will be played against the computer. The project will be broken down into certain components.

The first part will begin with a function that will randomly return 'Rock' or 'Paper' or 'Scissors' from an array list.  This will be considered the computers choice.
The second part will add on from the first part by taking in a user input and creating conditional statements depending on the selected combination by user and computer with a declared winner message.
